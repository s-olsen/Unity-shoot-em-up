# Unity-shoot-em-up
A unity game in which you pilot a ship that needs to shoot enemies down and make it across the map alive. This was a collaborative effort with 2 other students at the time during university. The main idea I had come up with was a mechanic that allows the player to change the angle of the camera view between side-on and a birds-eye view. In theory this would allow for the player to stragetically avoid obstacles or find new ways to beat a level but in practice it doesn't work so well. I personally created the 3d assets used in the game and programmed the enemy logic which, allowed them to find where the player is and aim to shoot at them.
This game was programmed in C#
